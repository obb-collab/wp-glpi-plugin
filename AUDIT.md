# Technical Audit Report

This audit covers the current state of the GLPI WordPress plugin.
It includes automated checks and a manual review performed in this
repository.

## Summary Table

| Tool | Target | Result |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| PHPCS (WordPress, Docs, VIP) | `glpi-api.php` | 174 errors, 6 warnings |
| ESLint (airbnb-base) | `glpi-new-task.js`, `gexe-filter.js` | 121 problems |
| PHPStan (level 4) | `glpi-api.php` | 9 errors |

## Notable Issues

### PHP Coding Standards
* `glpi-api.php` uses spaces for indentation and lacks file/class/function
  level documentation.
* Short array syntax and inline control structures are present.
* Several functions lack sanitization and rely on direct remote requests.

### JavaScript
* `glpi-new-task.js` defines functions before declaration and relies on
  unnamed callbacks.
* Missing spaces, missing arrow function parentheses, and string
  concatenation are prevalent.
* `gexe-filter.js` fails to parse due to an unexpected optional chaining
  token, indicating an outdated build target.

### Static Analysis (PHPStan)
* WordPress core functions like `wp_json_encode` and `wp_remote_request`
  were not found, suggesting missing stubs or improper bootstrapping for
  analysis.

### Security & SQL
* Direct calls to `wpdb` were not reviewed in depth. Future work should
  ensure all queries use prepared statements and proper capability checks.

### Assets & Build
* No build system exists for minification or bundling of JS/CSS.
  Consider adding a dedicated build step.

## Recommendations
1. Adopt WordPress Coding Standards across all PHP files and add missing
   PHPDoc blocks.
2. Refactor JavaScript to modern ES modules with lintâ€‘clean code and
   event delegation.
3. Provide stubs or bootstrap WordPress for static analysis tools.
4. Introduce a build pipeline and apply versioning via `filemtime` when
   enqueuing assets.
